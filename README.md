A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms for Dementia Prediction


## Abstract

Dementia, a progressively debilitating neurological disorder, presents a significant global health challenge, particularly in an aging population. The integration of advanced technological solutions, particularly Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, has gained traction to enhance accurate early detection. This paper explores the comparative efficiency of four prominent ML algorithms - Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost - for predicting dementia using a comprehensive dataset. The study reveals the pivotal role of features like ’CDR’ in accurate predictions across algorithms. Hyperparameter tuning’s impact on model performance is examined, showcasing XGBoost’s reliability and Decision Tree’s sensitivity. The significance of variability in accuracy scores and standard deviations is highlighted for comprehensive model assessment. Further, a detailed analysis of a Decision Tree’s structure offers insights into its decision-making process. The research emphasizes that model selection
extends beyond mere accuracy, necessitating a thorough understanding of feature importance and algorithm behavior. Ultimately, the study underscores the potential of machine learning in dementia prediction, showcasing the intricate interplay between algorithms, features, and tuning for robust and informed predictions.
